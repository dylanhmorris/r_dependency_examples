Maintainer: Me <me@mydomain.org>
Description: This package does absolutely nothing. It is a version of package4
    (which is installable via remotes::install_local())
    that remotes cannot install, because whereas package4 uses
    <name>=<repo> syntax to specify github remotes, package5 uses
    <name>=github::<repo> syntax.
